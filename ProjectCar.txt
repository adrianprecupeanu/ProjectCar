Everyone knows that a project car will eat your cash fast. This app helps you keep track of money spent, but also to plan in advance.
Also, you get easily carried away when you see some aesthetic part is on sale(but your car doesn't even start). With the help of this app,
and the 'priority' feature you can realize that you probably shouldn't buy that (for now), and you can just add it to the 'wish list',
with a low priority.
If you want to see some calculations, you just have to enter in the 'money pit' menu, where you can see the total sum invested, or the sum you need to
buy the items from the 'wish list', or the aproximation of the cost of the project car when it's 'done'(we all know a project car is never done though...)
If you want to see the money invested till now, you just tap a switch that substracts from the total invested sum, the parts that are

examples: 	1)you input the car part you want to buy, set a priority to it, and the estimate cost.
		2)after you've done step1, you can set it to 'bought'  and edit the price, and the car part is added to the list of 'improvements'
			
		-in each of this cases, the 'funds' tag gets updated, wich will always be displayed on top, so you know your limits everytime you plan
